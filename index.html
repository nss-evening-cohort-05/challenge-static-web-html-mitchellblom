Software programming is the Force that holds technology together and allows linguistic exchange to occur between cultures. It connects people across vast distances to communicate and collaborate, and that intersection of humanity and technology excites me. From my experience in sales, logistics, and non-profit, I have developed a deep appreciation for what coding can accomplish. Coding is not a trend: it is becoming more necessary for companies to compete digitally and succeed in the marketplace.

As the grandson of an Army civil engineer, I also got early exposure to woodworking and electrical projects.

In high school I discovered the guitar, and I was not content to merely know how to play; I had to know exactly how each component contributed to the overall tone of the instrument.
